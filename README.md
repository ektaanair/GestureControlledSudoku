# GestureControlledSudoku
This is an application I created using Python and SQL to help individuals with motor impairments rehabilitate in a more fun way. 
It allows users to create their own accounts to play endless Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulties, generated using web scraping algorithms.
The application supports keyboard inputs as well as gesture controls.

I initially came up with this idea while trying to keep my grandmother company as she went through her monotonous daily physiotherapy 
exercises when recovering from her recent surgery. I observed her pain, not only from the surgery she was recovering from, but from having 
to stare at a blank wall while doing repetetive exercises all day in the hopes of feeling stronger. I thought "There must be a better way
to do this!". And so i tried to make it. In its current version the program only supports hand gestures, but I hope to extend it to full body
movements in a future iteration to benefit the greatest number of people. 

More details regarding the technical specifications of the application, my inspirations, struggles and process can be found in 
the Project Report PDF.
